# fn

A fun programming languge.

Maybe easier to say what we hate about different languages, than what we love:

* Tuning GC.
* Formatting code. I don't care about opinions.
* Verbosity. Long words used when short words would be fine. My screen is only so big.
* Keyboard acrobatics. Code that looks like math. Syntax more like Ruby than C++.
